# nthWithProperty309(n) [20 pts]
# We will say that a number n has "Property309" if its 5th power contains every 
# digit (from 0 to 9) at least once. 309 is the smallest number with this property. 
# Write the function nthWithProperty309 that takes a non-negative int n and returns 
# the nth number with Property309.
